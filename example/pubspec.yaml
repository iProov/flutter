    # When depending on this package from a real application you should use:
    #   iproov_sdk: ^x.y.z
    # See https://dart.dev/tools/pub/dependencies#version-constraints
    # The example app is bundled with the plugin so we use a path dependency on
    # the parent directory to use the current plugin's version.
    # You will need the following instead of "path: ../":
    #     git:
    #       url: git@github.com:iProov/flutter.git
    path: ../
