## Introduction

The iProov Biometrics Flutter SDK wraps iProov's native [iOS](https://github.com/iProov/ios) (Swift) and [Android](https://github.com/iProov/android) (Java) SDKs behind a Dart interface for use from within your Flutter iOS or Android app.

We also provide an API Client written in Dart to call our [REST API v2](https://eu.rp.secure.iproov.me/docs.html) from a Flutter app, which can be used from your Flutter app to request tokens directly from the iProov API (note that this is not a secure way of getting tokens, and should only be used for demo/debugging purposes).

### Requirements

- Dart SDK 2.12 and above
- Flutter SDK 1.20 and above
- iOS 10.0 and above
- Android API Level 21 (Android 5 Lollipop) and above

### Preview

The iProov Biometrics Flutter SDK is currently in preview, which means that there may be missing/broken functionality, and the API is still subject to change. Please [contact us](mailto:support@iproov.com) to provide your feedback regarding the iProov Biometrics Flutter SDK Preview.

## Repository contents

The iProov Flutter SDK is provided via this repository, which contains the following:

- **README.md** - This document
- **example** - A demonstration Flutter App along with the Dart iProov API Client
- **lib** - Folder containing the Flutter (Dart) side of the SDK Plugin
- **android** - Folder containing the Android (Kotlin) native side of the SDK Plugin
- **ios** - Folder containing the iOS (Swift) native side of the SDK Plugin

## Registration

You can obtain API credentials by registering on the [iProov Partner Portal](https://portal.iproov.net).

## Installation

Add the following to your project's `pubspec.yml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  iproov_flutter: ^0.1.0
```

You can then install it with:

```
flutter pub get
```

### iOS installation

You must also add a `NSCameraUsageDescription` to your iOS app's Info.plist, with the reason why your app requires camera access (e.g. ‚ÄúTo iProov you in order to verify your identity.‚Äù)

## Get started

Once you have a valid token (obtained via the Dart API client or your own backend-to-backend call), you can `launch()` an iProov capture and handle the callback events as follows:

```dart
import 'package:iproov_flutter/iproov_flutter.dart';

IProov.launch(streamingUrl, token, options: options, callback: (event) {

 if (event is IProovEventConnecting) {
	// The SDK is connecting to the server. You should provide an indeterminate progress indicator
	// to let the user know that the connection is taking place.
  
  } else if (event is IProovEventConnected) {
	// The SDK has connected, and the iProov user interface will now be displayed. You should hide
	// any progress indication at this point.
  
  } else if (event is IProovEventProgress) {
	// The SDK will update your app with the progress of streaming to the server and authenticating
	// the user. This will be called multiple time as the progress updates.
  
  } else if (event is IProovEventSuccess) {
	// The user was successfully verified/enrolled and the token has been validated.
	// You can access the following properties:
	var token = result.token; // The token passed back will be the same as the one passed in to the original call
	var frame = result.frame; // An optional image containing a single frame of the user, if enabled for your service provider
  
  } else if (event is IProovEventCancelled) {
	// The user cancelled iProov, either by pressing the close button at the top right, or sending
	// the app to the background.
  
  } else if (event is IProovEventFailure) {
	// The user was not successfully verified/enrolled, as their identity could not be verified,
	// or there was another issue with their verification/enrollment. A reason (as a string)
	// is provided as to why the claim failed, along with a feedback code from the back-end.
	var feedbackCode = event.feedbackCode;
	var reason = event.reason;
  
  } else if (event is IProovEventError) {
	// The user was not successfully verified/enrolled due to an error (e.g. lost internet connection).
	// You will be provided with an Exception (see below).
	// It will be called once, or never.
  }
  
});
```

üëâ You should now familiarise yourself with the following resources:

-  [iProov Biometrics iOS SDK documentation](https://github.com/iProov/ios)
-  [Android Biometrics Android SDK documentation](https://github.com/iProov/android)

These repositories provide comprehensive documentation about the available customization options and other important details regarding the SDK usage.

## Options

The `Options` class allows iProov to be customized in various ways.

Most of these options are common to both Android and iOS, however, some are platform-specific (for example, iOS has a close button but Android does not).

For full documentation, please read the respective [iOS](https://github.com/iProov/ios#options) and [Android](https://github.com/iProov/android#options) native SDK documentation.

A summary of the support for the various SDK options in Flutter is provided below:

| Option | iOS | Android |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`Options.ui.`** |  |  |
| `filter` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| `lineColor` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | 
| `backgroundColor` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| `title` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| `fontPath` |  | ‚ö†Ô∏è (1) |
| `fontResource` |  | ‚ö†Ô∏è (1) |
| `font` | ‚ö†Ô∏è (1) |  |
| `logoImage` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| `closeButtonImage` | ‚úÖ |  |
| `closeButtonTintColor` | ‚úÖ |  |
| `enableScreenshots` |  | ‚úÖ  |
| `orientation` |  | ‚úÖ |
| `activityCompatibilityRequestCode` |  | ‚úÖ |
| **`Options.ui.genuinePresenceAssurance.`** |  |  |
| `autoStartDisabled` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| `notReadyTintColor` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| `readyTintColor` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| `progressBarColor` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| **`Options.ui.livenessAssurance.`** |  |  |
| `primaryTintColor` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| `secondaryTintColor` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| **`Options.network.`** |  |  |
| `certificates` | ‚ö†Ô∏è (2) | ‚ö†Ô∏è (2) |
| `timeout` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| `path` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| **`Options.capture.`** |  |  |
| `camera` |   | ‚úÖ |
| `faceDetector` |  | ‚úÖ |
| **`Options.capture.genuinePresenceAssurance.`** |  |  |
| `maxPitch` | ‚úÖ (3) | ‚úÖ (3) |
| `maxYaw` | ‚úÖ (3) | ‚úÖ (3) |
| `maxRoll` | ‚úÖ (3) | ‚úÖ (3) |

(1) There are currently different ways of setting fonts on iOS & Android. Fonts should be added to the respective iOS app bundle or Android project (`android/app/src/main/res/font`) and can then be set by name via this API. This is due to be revised in a future release.

(2) The certificates must be added to the respective iOS app bundle or Android project (`android/app/src/main/res/raw`) and the respective native option can then be set for the current platform (via `Platform.isAndroid` or `Platform.isIOS`). This is set to be improved in a future release.

(3) This is an advanced option and not recommended for general usage. If you wish to use this option, contact iProov for for further details.

## Handling errors

All errors from the native SDKs are re-mapped to Flutter exceptions:

| Exception | iOS | Android | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CaptureAlreadyActiveException` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | An existing iProov capture is already in progress. Wait until the current capture completes before starting a new one.
| `NetworkError` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | An error occurred with the video streaming process. Consult the `message` value for more information.
| `CameraPermissionError` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |  The user disallowed access to the camera when prompted. You should direct the user to re-enable camera access.
| `ServerException` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | A server-side error/token invalidation occurred. The associated `message` will contain further information about the error.
| `UnexpectedErrorException` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | An unexpected and unrecoverable error has occurred. These errors should be reported to iProov for further investigation.
| `ListenerNotRegisteredException` |  | ‚úÖ | The SDK was launched before a listener was registered.
| `MultiWindowUnsupportedException` |  | ‚úÖ | The user attempted to iProov in split-screen/multi-screen mode, which is not supported.
| `CameraException` |  | ‚úÖ | An error occurred acquiring or using the camera. This could happen when a non-phone is used with/without an external/USB camera.
| `FaceDetectorException` |  | ‚úÖ | An error occurred with the face detector.
| `InvalidOptionsException` |  | ‚úÖ | An error occurred when trying to apply your options.

## API Client

The Dart API Client provides a convenient wrapper to call iProov's REST API v2 from a Dart/Flutter app. It is a useful tool to assist with testing, debugging and demos, but should not be used in production mobile apps. You could also adapt this code to run on your back-end to perform server-to-server calls.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **SECURITY NOTICE:** Use of the Dart API Client requires providing it with your API secret. **You should never embed your API secret within a production app.**

The Dart API client can be found in `api_client.dart` in the Example project.

### Functionality

The Dart API Client supports the following functionality:

- `getToken()` - Get an enrol/verify token
- `enrolPhoto()` - Perform a photo enrolment (either from an electronic or optical image). The image must be provided as an [`Image`](https://pub.dev/packages/image).
- `enrolPhotoAndGetVerifyToken()` - A convenience method which first gets an enrolment token, then enrols the photo against that token, and then gets a verify token for the user to iProov against.

### Getting a token

The most basic thing you can do with the API Client is get a token to either enrol or verify a user, using either iProov's Genuine Presence Assurance or Liveness Assurance.

This is achieved as follows:

```dart
var apiClient = ApiClient(
  "https://eu.rp.secure.iproov.me/api/v2/", // Substitute URL as appropriate
  "< YOUR API KEY >",
  "< YOUR SECRET >"
);
var token = await apiClient.getToken(AssuranceType.genuinePresenceAssurance, ClaimType.enrol, "name@example.com");
```

You can then launch the iProov SDK with this token.

## Sample code

For a simple iProov experience that is ready to run out-of-the-box, check out the Flutter example project which also makes use of the Dart API Client.

> NOTE: iProov is not supported on the iOS or Android simulator, you must use a physical device in order to iProov.
